<h1>userv</h1>

<strong>Put the security boundary where it ought to be.</strong>

<p>

userv (pronounced <cite>you-serve</cite>) is a program which,
according to the specification, is
<blockquote>
a Unix system facility to allow one program to invoke another when
only limited trust exists between them.
</blockquote>

<p>

It is a tool for system administrators, who often find themselves with
a program running as one user which needs to be able to do certain
things as another user.  For example, my machine's news system needs
to scan my users' newsrcs to ensure that the right newsgroups are
fetched.  Before userv that part of the news system had to run as
root, and clumsily use `su'.

<p>

It is also a component for application authors.  For example, imagine
a version of `cron' which didn't need to run as root, so that a
security bug in cron would just mean that bad people could get cron
jobs to run at the wrong times, rather than everyone on the system
being able to break in completely.  Imagine being able to do
sophisticated mail filtering at delivery time without the mail
transfer or delivery agents needing to be root.
